# Brew Casks

If I want to set the default download location to my user applications folder which makes it only accessible to me, then use this setting:

```sh
Set the default home-brew application directory as my user directory
export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=~/Applications --fontdir=/Library/Fonts"
```

## Work
Slack, Rectangle, Alfred, Chrome, Firefox, Alfred - All M1

```sh
brew install --cask \
  spotify \
  rectangle \
  google-chrome \
  slack \
  firefox \
  alfred
```

## Personal 

- [Atom](https://atom.io/): An open source editor built and maintained by GitHub, is very similar to Sublime Text in most aspects.

## Productivity


- Caffiene 
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/): File syncing to the cloud. It syncs files across all devices (laptop, mobile, tablet), and serves as a backup as well!
- [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/): f.lux makes the color of your computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day (If you are running macOS 10.12.4 or later there's native functionality called 'Night Shift' that does the same thing as f.lux, see System Preferences -> Displays -> Night Shift).
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/): File syncing to the cloud too! Google Docs is a popular tool to collaborate with others.
